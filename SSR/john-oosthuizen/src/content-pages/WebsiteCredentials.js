            I attained the B.Sc (Mathematics, Computer Science) degree at the KwaZulu-Natal University in 
            Durban in 1978. While working at IBM as an IT developer and later an IT architect, I became 
            proficient at developing websites and web applications in various programming languages 
            including Java and Javascript. I attained certifications from Sun Microsystems as 
            Java Developer and Java Architect, and a 'Certified IT Architect' professional 
            certification from IBM.</p> 
            <p>More recently, I focused on front-end development using 
            modern tools.
            Despite setbacks as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the increased reliance on 
            the Internet presented an opportunity for me to design website generation templates that 
            would meet the majority of client requirements at a fraction of the cost of a 
            custom-designed website. This offering passes this benefit to clients.
