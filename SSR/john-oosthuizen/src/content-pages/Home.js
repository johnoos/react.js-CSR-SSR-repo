            <p>Welcome to my website where I introduce my music theory tuition 
                by videoconference and my website development and hosting service. Both offerings
                are aimed at the music community, especially learners and students, and have 
                been priced accordingly.
            </p>
            <p>Music theory tuition by videoconference has been proven to be 
                viable by music teachers in Stellenbosch and elsewhere. Learners and 
                students alike are typically adept at, and enjoy using their mobile phone cameras.  
                During videoconference sessions, tutors and learners use mobile cameras to 
                share documents for instruction and homework review. I studied music theory 
                at Stellenbosch University and as an exchange student in the USA. 
                My academic qualifications, CV, and reference letters can be downloaded 
                from this website.</p>

                Since the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic, there has been an increased reliance on 
                social media and websites for income generation. 
                I am a qualified IT professional and have developed templates that enable 
                rapid generation of websites that meet most client requirements. 
                This produces affordable websites that are expandable where additional 
                functionality is required.
