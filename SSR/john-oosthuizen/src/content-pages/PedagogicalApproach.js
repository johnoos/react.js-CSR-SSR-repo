            <p>Learners are assessed initially and annually, and a target Trinity College grade level is recommended. 
                Objectives are discussed, agreed, documented, and accessed online with a userID. 
                Progress against the target syllabus is tracked on a quarterly basis. Adult and child beginners
                are assisted to progress at their own pace. For tertiary education students requiring assistance, 
                'extra lessons' can be arranged on-demand.</p>    
                <p>Classes are normally scheduled weekly and any missed classes are rescheduled on a 
                best-efforts basis. Each class is divided into marking homework, covering new material, 
                and allocating new homework. 
                As an undergraduate student, I regularly assisted fellow students 
                in understanding theory hnd harmony concepts. In the roles of church music director and 
                organist/pianist, I regularly had to help choristers to develop their musical skills.</p>
