            <h2>Music theory</h2>
            <p>I attained the BMus Honours (cum laude) degree at Stellenbosch University in December 2019
                and studied Advanced Tonal Analysis in the USA in the first half of 2020 as a Stellenbosch 
                exchange student. My master's degree will be completed this year after which I will register 
                as a PhD (Music) student in 2021. 
                My music CV, credentials, and academic and character references can be 
                downloaded from this website. Learners receive theory tuition based mainly on the current 
                Trinity College and UNISA syllabuses to prepare them for exams at the appropriate levels. 
                My recently completed music theory studies at Stellenbosch University and the USA positioned me
                well to assist university students that require extra lessons. Tuition fees are aimed at 
                the learner and student markets across geographies and are competitive. 
                See the relevant menu item for the fee.</p> 
            <p> Music theory by videoconferencing is viable, as mobile phone cameras are used innovatively
                by tutors to give instruction and by students to show homework. 
                Students and tutors work collaboratively as if physically side by side. 
                Should data bandwidth be inadequate, the session is downgraded from video to audio, and 
                instruction and homework are exchanged by Whatsapp or email. This technique
                has been demonstrated in Stellenbosch to work well.</p>    
                <h2>Pedagogical approach</h2>
                <p>Learners are assessed initially and annually, and a target grade level and institution
                is recommended. 
                Objectives are discussed, agreed, documented, and accessed online with the learner's userID to
                ensure privacy. Progress against the target syllabus is tracked on a quarterly basis. 
                Adult beginners are welcome.</p>
                <p> 
                As an undergraduate student I regularly assisted fellow students 
                with theory and harmony. As church music director and 
                organist/pianist, I regularly helped choristers to develop their 
                musical skills. I am, therefore, confident in my ability to assist learners of all ages.</p>
