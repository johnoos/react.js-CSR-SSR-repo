            <h2>Websites from templates</h2> 
            <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has increased the need to have a digital presence. 
                This is especially true for musicians as many of us are reliant on
                virtual concerts and online tuition in the 'new normal'. 
                Personal websites give us social media visibility and act as our online 
                'face'. They need to be both functional and aesthetically pleasing.
                They also need to be <i>discoverable</i> through 
                <ul>
                    <li>sharing to Facebook using the button provided in the website header (see above), and</li>
                    <li>search engine optimisation (SEO) that ensures your website appears high on
                        'hitlists' when interested parties perform searches using one of a set of predefined
                        keywords.</li>        
                </ul> 
            </p>
            <p>I am a graduated IT professional and create and host websites such as this one. 
                See the relevant menu item for my IT CV, credentials, and references. Websites 
                are rapidly produced from my templates and are, therefore, priced highly competitively. 
                Music students that need to generate an income from virtual concerts or online tuition 
                are among many that could benefit. </p>
            <p>Having domain names that reflect one's name is a luxury and comes at a price. I provide 
                website links based on the bit.ly url shortening service that have a descriptive element
                of your choice. It will be similar to the link to this website
                which is http://bit.ly/joosthuizen, and it's free. 
                Websites are tested on all the popular browsers.</p>
