            <h3>Music theory</h3>
            <p>I received the BMus Honours (cum laude) degree at Stellenbosch University in December 2019
                and studied Advanced Tonal Analysis in the USA as a Stellenbosch exchange student in the 
                first half of 2020. My master's degree will be completed this year after which I will register 
                as a PhD (Music) student in 2021. 
                My music CV and credentials can be downloaded <a href="xxx">here</a>. 
                I give music theory tuition based mainly on the current Trinity College syllabus to prepare 
                learners, students, and adult beginners for the full range of graded exams. 
                Tuition fees are aimed at the learner and student markets and are, therefore, 
                highly competitive. The fee structure can be seen <a href="xxx">here</a>.</p> 
            <p> Music theory by videoconferencing is viable, as the cameras of mobile phones are used innovatively
                by the tutor to give instruction and by the student to show homework done. 
                Should data bandwidth be inadequate, the session is downgraded to audio and instruction 
                and homework is exchanged by Whatsapp or email. This technique
                has been proven to work well.</p>    
            <h3>Websites from templates</h3>  
            <p>I am also a graduated IT professional and create and host websites such as this one. 
                My IT CV and credentials can be downloaded <a href="xxx">here</a>. Websites are rapidly
                produced from templates and, therefore, priced highly competitively. Music students 
                that need to generate an income from virtual concerts or online tuition are among many that  
                could benefit. The fee structure can be seen <a href="xxx">here</a>.</p>
