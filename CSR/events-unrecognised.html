/*****   MORE NOTES ON THE SUBJECT

    When dealing with events in React, the value of 'this' inside your event handler is different 
    from what you would normally see in the non-React DOM world. 
    In the non-React world, the value of 'this' inside an event handler refers to the element that 
    your event is listening on:
            function doSomething(e) { console.log(this); }
            var foo = document.querySelector("button");
            foo.addEventListener("click", doSomething, false);
    In the React world (i.e. when your components are created using React.createClass), the value
    of 'this' inside your event handler always refers to the component the event handler lives in.
    
    var CounterParent = React.createClass({ 
        getInitialState: function() {
           return { count: 0 }; 
        },
        increase: function(e) {
            console.log(this); // CounterParent component
            this.setState({
             count: this.state.count + 1}); 
        },
        render: function() { return (
            <div>
                <Counter display={this.state.count}/> 
                <button onClick={this.increase}>
                +
                </button>
            </div> );
        } 
    });

    In this example, the value of 'this' inside the increase event handler refers to the CounterParent 
    component. It doesnâ€™t refer to the element that triggered the event. 
    You get this behavior because React automatically binds all methods inside a component to this, EXCEPT
    WITH ES6 where binds to 'this' are explicit.

        <button onClick={this.increase.bind(this)}>+</button>
